// Making a sprite involves three steps which are outlined below. You probably
// would want to combine them into a utility function with defaults pertinent
// to your game.

// 1: Geometry
// This defines the local shape of the object. In this case the geometry
// will simply be a 1x1 plane facing the camera.

// 2: Material
// This defines how the surface of the shape is painted. In this case we
// want to paint a texture loaded from an asset and also tint it.
// Nearest-neighbor filtering with `THREE.NearestFilter` is nice for
// pixel art styles.

// 3: Mesh
// A mesh is a node in THREE's scenegraph and refers to a geometry and a
// material to draw itself. It can be translated and rotated as any other
// scenegraph node.

// Creates a single pillar and returns the mesh
